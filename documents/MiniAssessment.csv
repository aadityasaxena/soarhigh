Often, founders have personally experienced the very problems that they are trying to solve for a larger customer base","The founding team needs to engage with more potential customers to ensure that they don't fall into the trap of a ""solution looking for a problem"".

These can accrue from the education, job, and/or prior entrepreneurship experience of the existing team, or maybe supplemented by new co-founders, new hires, consultants, and partners. Investors consider the team behind a startup more important than the idea or the product, hence will want to know if the team has the right set of skills, drive, experience, and temperament to grow the business.

The startup needs to identify and classify customer segments based on their commercial relationship with the venture, e.g. free users, paying customers, retail vs enterprise customers.

This is done with top-down calculations based on secondary research as well as bottom-up calculations based on business plans. Founders must find answers to questions such as: how big the market is today, how fast it's growing, and why it's going to be big in ten years.

A revenue model is important for the company's long-term business vitality as it gives an overview of the company's current and future potential to earn profits.
